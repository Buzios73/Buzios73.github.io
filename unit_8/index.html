                    <p>This Neil is an American actor, producer, singer, comedian, magician, and television host. He is known for playing Barney Stinson in the television comedy series <a href="#">How I Met Your Mother</a>, for which he was nominated for four Emmy Awards, and for his role as the title character in Doogie Howser, M.D. That's great and all, but does he wear a tie with our solar system on it?

                    <p>Here's another Neil that can sing. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame website describes Young as "one of rock and roll's greatest songwriters and performers".
